# Go Limit

This project implements a route-based rate limit system in Go, initiated from the gofast template. It leverages the [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) framework for API routing, ensuring a robust and flexible structure. The standout feature of this implementation is the ability to apply rate limiting on specific routes, providing granular control over traffic

**Key Features:**
